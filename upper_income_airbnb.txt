Ski season is just around the corner and we invite you to take in all of Tahoe's mountain options from our cozy lakeside studio central to all things that make Tahoe so special.\n\nWe genuinely value your vacation time and although we feel our little piece of Tahoe is perfect for all occasions, we would rather recommend accommodations that fit your needs than take a booking mismatch.  If, after reading about our space, you have any questions please feel free to ask. \n\nOur condo is a classic north shore studio on the lake and within the Franciscan Lakeside Lodge community. Perfect for those that want the value of an AIRBNB booking but prefer the privacy, location, amenities  and convenience of traditional vacation lodging at Lake Tahoe. \n\nOur studio is a privately owned condo in a motor lodge style community. The Franciscan is a well known landmark of North Lake. It is small but comfortable, clean, well maintained and the location on the lake cannot be matched at our price point. We offer substantial value as our unit is closest to the road but not the furthest from the beach. \n\nIf your primary reason for visiting the area is outdoor recreation and close proximity to the lake, ski resorts and access to the national forest then our studio has everything you need. \n\nThe community is relatively easy going and our studio is perfect for two people wanting to facilitate access to outdoor activities. There are very few luxury and no high-rise hotels on the north shore between Incline Village, NV and Tahoe City making the Franciscan very typical motor lodging for the N. Shore. Serene, vintage, Tahoe.  Because this is a studio we don't recommend more than 2 guests regardless of age and offer one parking spot for our guests. The unit has a comfortable queen bed, flat screen TV (with DVD player and cable), dinette table and fully furnished kitchen including microwave, refrigerator, stove top, oven, dishes, silverware, and pots and pans and coffee \n\nOur studio is #16 which is situated on the lake side of N. Tahoe Blvd at the end of single level 4 unit complex. Please note: One wall is adjacent to another unit. The other wall is on the end of the complex on the street side. We are closest to the street so please expect some ambient street noise that varies seasonally. \n\nThe condo is professionally cleaned prior to check in but there is no daily maid service. There are extra supplies in the closet near the bathroom. Should you need anything during your stay, please do not hesitate to contact us?\n\nOur studio in located within a private beach front community with BBQs for all guests, a heated pool and volleyball court in the summer. Boat mooring buoys also are available upon request for an additional fee, subject to availability. Please be advised there is no towel service at the pool or beach. Please bring your own beach towels. Please do not use bathroom towels at the beach or pool.\n\nBecause we value your vacation time and take our hosting responsibilities seriously, we only interact on an as needed basis with our guests to answer questions, suggestions about things to do, and generally let you enjoy your stay uninterrupted. We are always an email or call away if needed and pride ourselves on being responsive.\n\nBoat ramps are very close by but subject to closure depending on conditions. The condo has mooring buoys available upon request for an additional fee, subject to availability.\n\nThis location is perfectly situated in the Tahoe National Forest, but also just minutes from Northstar Ski Resort, Diamond Peak Ski Resort, Alpine Meadows, and Homewood. Safeway supermarket and great restaurants nearby, and under 3 miles to the Nevada border and casinos.\n\nNorthstar: Closest resort with a great village.\nAlpine Meadows: Closest big mtn skiing but pricey.\nHomewood: Best value mtn. Mostly slower lifts but great mtn for the price.\nDiamond Peak: Just to say you went skiing.  Great for kids.\nSquaw: Squaw is Squaw.\n\nNorth Tahoe is quiet and offers a much slower pace than other areas of the lake. If you are looking for a fast paced getaway you will probably be disappointed with Tahoe North.\n\nDuring winter months Northstar ski resort has a complimentary shuttle pick up and drop off location on North Lake Blvd in front of the neighboring property. See images for more information and the phone number. \n\nTART is the local bus, which carries people around the lake and into Truckee. There is a stop just out front.\n\nThe wireless Internet at this location is only suitable for the most basic of Internet activities like checking email.

I give an access code to the home and a home manual.\n\nThe Montgomery Estates neighborhood is one of the best in South Lake Tahoe. You'll find a very quiet street with nicer homes on larger lots. Forest service land backs to the home and there is an unbuildable Forest Service lot in front of the house for added privacy and a woodsy feel. At the same time, you are only a 5 minute drive from Heavenly, the Casinos and Lake Tahoe.\n\nIn winter months, please check with California's Department of Transportation website for road conditions, restrictions &amp; closures. It is advisable to always carry chains, especially with 2wd vehicles.\n\nOperating under El Dorado County Vacation Rental Permit #1193\n\nThe Powerline Trail starts in the backyard. This mellow trail leads to lake views and either Cold Creek to the South or Heavenly to the Northeast. It is a great trail for hikes, snowshoeing, mountain biking, and cross country skiing. It joins up with the Cold Creek Trail which is one of the best and least known Tahoe mountain biking trails.\n\nThe county of South Lake Tahoe mandates that hot tubs cannot be used between the hours of 10 pm and 6 am, due to noise violations and disturbances from vacation rental homes. Please adhere to these rules-non compliance can result in the loss of your deposit.

Make sure they're perpendicular to the pane of the closed glass doors, or fireplace opening. These large logs will be the bed of the fire and contain the embers to feed it.\n2 Place one cross-bar across the two large logs. This log should be about the diameter of your forearm, and it should rest parallel to the pane of the glass door or fireplace opening, closer to the opening of the fireplace.\n•This cross-bar will hold the other firewood and keep an air vent open where the fire can draw fresh air to feed it from underneath.\n3 Crumple newspapers (not glossy paper) on the bottom of the fireplace. Alternately, use other tinder like dried twigs or wood shavings as a base.\n4 Place some kindling on top of the newspaper. Do not put any larger logs or fuel on top yet. If you can stack the kindling in a grid fashion, leaving plenty of space in between for air to pass through.\n5 Light the fire from the newspaper or tinder. Make sure that the kindle starts to burn — you'll want to hear crackling noises.\n6 Place some logs in between the large logs on top of the cross-bar. Again, these logs should be (about half the diameter of your forearm, resting parallel wit the cross-bar. Keep this arrangement at all times: two logs, one cross-bar on top and firewood held by the cross-bar.\n7 Finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost importantly - relax and have fun!

There are many amazing restaurants in the area and other cocktail bars however my street is extremely quiet for a good night's sleep.\n\nThe apartment is close to the ACE and 123   subway line and about 6 blocks from the 456. Although I do not have a parking space there is free street parking directly in front of the apartment if you can find a spot.\n\nThe ACE line is the line to go all the way to JFK ($3 + 5$) or Laguardia ($3). That being said it is also an easy cab ride (25 minutes without traffic).

We have a room available to rent in our colorful 2 bedroom apt.  (my boyfriend and I have the other room).  Our building was built in 1910, and renovated in 1980; it has retained its character, its older design, and historical look.\n\nThe room itself is furnished with a queen size bed (firm and new) which fills a portion of the room, an armoire, a rack to hang clothes, a small dresser, tv screen w/ DVD player. There is a portable fan for use and a  a two-way fan in the window for a breeze. The room is  6 ' by 10 ' (small), and comfortable for someone who wants to throw their feet up and relax after a day of exploring the city and/or doesn't need a big room. The room faces a locked courtyard that the super uses to do his work. \n\nI provide clean linens and towels, soap, shampoo &amp; toothpaste, and you can use my hairdryer. \n\nI've been a homestay provider for Kaplan (a school that teaches English to people who come from all around the world)  for a few years now, and I love it :). I thought I'd give BnB a try in between students.  I'm easy to get along with, very patient, and will answer your questions in a timely manner.\n\nI am a big animal lover, and have 5\n cats.

The apt is within walking distance to celebrity hotspots, grocery stores, and Starbucks.\n\nThis apartment is unique due to its central location and amenities. This apartment is on the border of West Hollywood and Beverly Hills, which is generally a $4 uber ride from every major club and restaurant.

Also, the apartment is outfitted with air conditioning, which is very rare in LA, and guests have access to a 5 gallon Arrowhead water cooler.\n\nGuests will have access to all areas of the apartment, except for one closet.\n\nI am a travel expert and blogger and can give guests great recommendations for the stay. I give all guests a guidebook on what to do upon their arrival.\n\nSince I am a fellow traveler, I will do my best to have access with the guests during the stay. If I will not have full access, I will make sure to let the guests know and try to answer all their questions before they start their stay.\n\nBeverly Hills is an extremely safe and centrally located part of Los Angeles. I love it, because you can actually walk to places! You can walk to two grocery stores, two coffee shops, a bank, and a ton of hot restaurants.

You're also a short $4 Uber ride from downtown Beverly Hills where you can take pictures on the famed Rodeo Drive and dine at Mastro's and the Palm.\n\nI highly suggest Uber as Beverly Hills, and Los Angeles in general, have strict parking regulations. Both Uber X and Lyft are extremely active, safe, cheap, and reliable in Los Angeles.

The Balboa Fun Zone is a 5 minute walk and there you'll find the ferries to Balboa Island and Catalina, along with the boarding areas for whale watching, fishing trips, the submarine tour and sunset cruises... and much more, like the famous Newport Landing, Harborside  and San Shi Go restaurants, along with more casual eateries like Great Mex, Cruisers and BJ's Pizza. Laventina's Pizza and Mint Leaf Thai deliver for free. Don't forget to check out Ruby's rooftop deck at the end of the Balboa pier. The Newport Pier is where you'll find Sharkeys, Blue Beet, Stag Bar, Blackies, Aurora and so much more, and is about a 15 minute scenic walk or easy bike ride away. Don't miss Aurora; tell Joe that Kathy sent 'ya. The sangria is AMAZING.\n\nThis space includes one private, off-street parking space with 24-hr camera surveillance. There is a free transportation service on the peninsula sponsored by local businesses which will deliver you wherever you want to go. Download the down towner dot calm. *Snicker*. Uber and Lyft are readily available but there's nothing better than bringing down your bikes and using the boardwalk. You can ride from the Wedge past Huntington Beach if you like, and then some. The peninsula is very bike and pedestrian friendly, although don't forget to look before you cross the street! FYI, pedestrians have the right of way only on foot inside marked crosswalks, not at signals! If you're driving, please don't exceed 30mph and PLEASE stop for peds. You're not in a rush; it's vacation! =)\n\nThere are three, nearly identical 1,100 sf units here.  Two are occupied year-round. Yours is the biggest of the three thanks to the giant sunroom and patio. We are on the beach side of the road and the bay, with public beaches 50 feet away and the calm water of the bay is just across the street.

Our cute 2x1 apartment is just 1/2 a mile from the beautiful Newport Beach sand!\n\nSince we are rarely home, you will be able to have free reign of the apartment to use as yours!

A full bathroom that you will share with us if we are around that weekend. The full kitchen, you can use the fridge and stove as much as you'd like. There is a large common living space with a large tv with cable and Netflix available. You will also have Wifi access. There are two assigned parking spots available.\n\nOn weekends we are normally in and out, but mostly out and back to retire in the later evening.Since we are rarely around, we will most likely stay in our bedroom because we will be asleep! We also will be out of town a lot this year so we will let you know if we will be present or if even one of us will be out of town during your reserved time.\n\nWalk to the beach in less than 15 minutes, it's a direct 1/2 mile route! Sunset Ridge park is 1/2 a block from our front door, featuring a bluff ocean view. Several restaurants and grocery stores in the surrounding area that are also walkable.

This adorable downstairs unit has two rooms, a family room, one bathroom, and a small kitchenette.  It is literally steps from the sand and is close to everything you will need for your stay in Newport Beach!\n\nThis cute downstairs unit was built in the 1930's.  It is the perfect place to come in out of the sun and rest until more fun the next day.  There is room for four.  This bungalow has been updated, but is still an older style with no heating or air conditioning.  The access to the beach sets it up as a perfect site for a quick getaway - you will hardly need to stay in the bungalow at all with all the fun there is at hand.\n\nThis is a downstairs unit with 2 small bedrooms and 1 bath.  There is a small enclosed area with gate access to an alley (W. Oceanfront Street) that intersects 30th and 31st Streets.\n\nThere is no designated parking and finding a spot can sometimes take some effort.  There are spaces on the street and also metered lots.  As soon as you find an awesome spot, just settle in for the week and bike or walk everywhere!  Everything you need is that close.\n\nLet us know if you need help or have questions! We are available by text.\n\n30th Street in Newport Beach is right in the heart of this renown beach city.  During the summer months, there are many visitors staying in homes up and down the street.  Sometimes things can get a little loud, but generally the area is friendly and safe.\n\nThere is no onsite parking, so parking can sometimes be an issue.  There are free spaces available on the street and there are two public lots with meters within walking distance.  The meters run from 8:00am to 6:00pm and can be reset using your cell phone (basically you feed the meter from your phone) - awesome idea.  Most people park for the week and walk and ride their bikes everywhere they need to go.\n\nRight in the heart of Newport Beach, this beach bungalow is steps from the beach, and within walking distance of Newport Beach Pier, Blackies Surf Spot, a grocery store, laundromat, and dozens of restaurants and nightlife.  If you bring or rent beach cruisers, you can ride south on the boardwalk to the Balboa Island Ferry and the World Famous Wedge - or you can ride north to Huntington Beach, the site of the US Open of Surfing.  There is plenty to do everywhere around you!!

Just a couple miles from Fashion Island and Balboa Island and 'The Peninsula'. If you want to be on the waterfront this is the most central location available in Newport Beach. Located Just 20 Minutes away from John Wayne Airport and 10 Minutes to the Nearest Freeway.\n\nJust a short walk to Balboa Bay Club, Pizza Nova, Joe's Crab Shack, Rusty Pelican (seafood), Billy's at the Beach Bar and Grill, The Ritz, The Winery, 'A' Bar and 'A' Restaurant (my personal favorite), Rock Fire Grill, Mariners Coffee Shop (great breakfast), C'est Si Bon Bakery, and Baja Beach Cafe.

The perfect place to stay for your visit to Stanford, Palo Alto, or Silicon Valley.\n\nThis simple and quiet cottage is in a wonderful Palo Alto location.  Three blocks from downtown Palo Alto, a half mile from the bus and train station and Stanford mall, and 1.5 miles from the center of Stanford's campus.  It's easy to get here and get around even with no car!  We're also across the street from a lovely park, in case you're visiting with kids.\n\nThe cottage bedroom has a queen size bed that we have been told is very soft and luxurious.  The bathroom is newly renovated with a tile shower and floor.  There is a small kitchen with a microwave, cooktop, breakfast bar, and skylight which connects to the living room.  There is free wi-fi and an in-unit washer and dryer.  The parking is on-street and plentiful.  We provide you with a temporary parking permit to hang in your window while you're here.  We can make a port-a-crib and stroller available for your use if you're here.  \n\nI keep the calendar updated, so you should assume that if dates you are interested in are shown as not available, then they are not.  Also I will not accept reservations more than three months in advance.  I absolutely will not accept reservations for stays longer than 6 weeks.\n\nWe really appreciate any feedback our guests have on how to make our cottage more comfortable!\n\nGuests will have the entire cottage to themselves.  The entrance to the cottage is off a patio that is shared with the main house.  During summer months we typically keep a table and chairs on the patio and you are welcome to enjoy those.  \n\nWe typically try to greet guests as soon as we see them after they arrive and then will chit chat if we see them on the patio or driveway after that.  We are very happy to chat more though if you're interested. I especially like recommending my favorite restaurants and places to visit in the area as well as hearing more about what brings people to the area.\n\nI love how near our neighborhood is to so many great shops and restaurants.  \n\nPublic transit is very convenient - we are about a half mile from the bus and train stations.  \n\nParking is on street and easy to find. \n\nIt is possible, but annoying, to get to our house from the airport using public transit.  I recommend a rented car, taxi, or shuttle.\n\nOur check-in/check-out times are often flexible.  Please feel free to inquire when you make your reservation if you would like an adjustment to these times and we will accommodate you as best we can.
