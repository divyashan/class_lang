Our family's home has a room located in Boston/Dorchester off the MBTA Red Line at Fields Corner. It's charming, comfortable and receives an abundant amount of sunlight in the mornings. You'll love the house's cultural influence and offer access to the amenities to make your stay welcoming. The downtown commute is convenient, about 4-5 min walk to the train/bus station. FREE STREET PARKING. Great for couples, we put effort in providing you the accommodations to have a successful, enjoyable trip!\n\nOur space is extremely comfortable and heartwarming, but what makes it really unique is that it creates a feeling of a home away from home. Whether you're traveling casually on or business, our accommodation will suit your needs perfectly within a delightful, cultured environment.\n\nGuests have access to the 1st floor lounge room equipped with large flat screen TV (Xfinity cable), bamboo couches, and peaceful reading/study area. It is adjacent to the 1st floor full bathroom at your exposal with amenities included (shampoo, conditioner, soap).\n\nThere is also a large table dining area including a coffee and tea station for your enjoyment. The kitchen may be used if you ask and refrigerator will have space partitioned for use.\n\nDuring your visit, we will likely cross paths and share a friendly hello! Our family of 4 (an older couple and younger couple) will be at the house a majority of the week when not working or at school. It can be your preference on the level of interaction from as far as sitting down and enjoying a meal or conversation to simply passing through. However, whatever your needs may be, we are very welcoming and are here for your enjoyment.\n\nThe best characteristic about our neighborhood is it's diversity. Although some may find it overwhelming or intimidating to see so many different people doing different things, we love and embrace it. Our street in particular is very family-oriented and kind, in which we have made positive connections with our immediate neighbors and even belong to the local neighborhood watch. There are schools within 5 minutes walking in either direction, and it is evident by how busy it is during the week. At night, people are generally quiet (maybe some weekend music) but may be out around the stores near the train area. In our year of living in this area- we have never had any problems, continue to feel comfortable living here, and want that feeling to convey to you while being our guest.\n\nA definite highlight is that there is free street parking in front of the house. If you are commuting via public transportation, the MBTA Red Line + Busses are a 4-5 minute walk away. The train from there takes 15-20 minutes to reach downtown and connecting lines. Lastly, there is a Zipcar lot also just another 3-4 minute walk from the house.\n\nThings to do in Boston to make your visit memorable!\n\nPrudential area:\n-\

It has some of its original 110-year-old detail and that can be a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective.\n2) you are open minded.\n3) you understand that this is a quirky private older home and not a homogeneous hotel or newly constructed McMansion.\n4) you are okay with cats.  They do not live in this apartment (unless you want them to) and they will certainly not enter your bedroom but I have recently begun caring for a semi-feral colony in the neighborhood and some of them are socializing well so I hope to find good homes for them.  (If you fall in love with a cat, take it home!)  They may greet you (or run away from you) on the porch.

I love the privacy, quietness, and the surrounding of nature.  Each house on the block is unique and holds some kind of history.  I could go outside to meditate with the sounds of nature and my neighbor's waterfall.  My house is on a hill with a really nice view and a great breeze that soars through the house.  My area makes you feel like you are miles away from town, but not even a mile away from civilization.  This area is compared to Topanga Cyn.\n\nAbout 500 sq ft.  Like an apartment under main house.\n\nThe entire downstairs\n\nI am available through text or call.\n\nIt's beautiful...that is what I always hear, from my first time guests.  I live in a canyon, so I have some critters that will come visit, at times.  There are hiking trails and a park within walking distance.  It is very dark in this area and there are no streetlights.  So you need to be careful where you walk.  I recommend to bring a flashlight.  However, I have put up lights throughout the property for safety.  Lastly, very quiet and peaceful, day and night.\n\nI am about 2 miles from the train station and there is city transportation.\n\nYou will have your own private entrance, private room, patio, fire pit, kitchenette, with microwave, toaster over, fridge, coffee maker, and Netflix.  I have a dog, a baby gate will go up, so that he does not bother you during your stay.  He stays upstairs and he is 14.  There is only one bathroom and it is downstairs.  So I will have to use it as well.  I will work around your schedule.  There are a few stairs to get to my house.  I live in a canyon and on a hill.  Please wear comfortable shoes.  The climb is worth it.  Lots of privacy and beautiful views.   I will assist with carrying any baggage if traveling with a heavy load.  There is a washer, but I save energy, by hanging drying my laundry.  I am in a CANYON and in county limits.  There are no street lights in this neighborhood, so please bring a flash light if you arriving in the evening.  There will be lights lit all the way along the stairs to the guest house entrance.  There is parking on the street and basically where you see a spot, is a place to park.  City rules do not apply to county.
